# Code Refactor: Horiseon

## Description

This project is a code refactoring that changed the following for the homepage of a company called Horiseon: substituted in proper semantic tags; reduced CSS rule redundancies within the "benefits" section of the page; made changes to HTML metadata and anchor elements.

Link to deployed website:

## Usage

​
As currently set up, the page has deliberately limited functionality. Clicking on the navigation elements at the top of the page brings the user to their respectively named sections further down the page.

Other than that, it is a basic webpage displaying information on the main services and benefits offered by Horiseon.

See screenshot of the deployed webpage, below:
