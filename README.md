​
At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out?
​

## Usage

​
As currently set up, the page has deliberately limited functionality. Clicking on the navigation elements at the top of the page brings the user to their respectively named sections further down the page.

Other than that, it is a basic webpage displaying information on the main services and benefits offered by Horiseon.

See screenshot of the deployed webpage, below:
​
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
​

```md
![alt text](Assets\01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)
```
